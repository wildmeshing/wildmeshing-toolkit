# If true, horizontally aligns arguments after an open bracket.
# This applies to round brackets (parentheses), angle brackets and square brackets. This will result in formattings like code someLongFunction(argument1, argument2); endcode

AllowAllParametersOfDeclarationOnNextLine: false

# Allows contracting simple braced statements to a single line.
# E.g., this allows if (a) { return; } to be put on a single line.

# If true, format braced lists as best suited for C++11 braced lists.
# Important differences: - No spaces inside the braced list. - No line break before the closing brace. - Indentation with the continuation indent, not with the block indent.
# Fundamentally, C++11 braced lists are formatted exactly like function calls would be formatted in their place. If the braced list follows a name (e.g. a type or variable name), clang-format formats as if the {} were the parentheses of a function call with that name. If there is no name, a zero-length name is assumed.

DerivePointerAlignment: false

# Disables formatting at all.
#DisableFormat: false

# If true, clang-format detects whether function calls and definitions are formatted with one parameter per line.
# Each call can be bin-packed, one-per-line or inconclusive. If it is inconclusive, e.g. completely on one line, but a decision needs to be made, clang-format analyzes whether there are other bin-packed cases in the input file and act accordingly.
# NOTE: This is an experimental flag, that might go away or be renamed. Do not use this in config files, etc. Use at your own risk.
#ExperimentalAutoDetectBinPacking: false

# If true, clang-format adds missing namespace end comments and fixes invalid existing ones.

# Dependent on the value, multiple #include blocks can be sorted as one and divided based on category.
